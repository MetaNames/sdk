# Meta Names SDK

The Meta Names SDK library is a useful resource that allows for smooth communication with the Meta Names domain name system.

This library is specifically designed to work with the Partisia Blockchain, making it simple to integrate and manage DNS features. With this library, you can easily register a domain, handle domain records, and ensure seamless domain name resolution.
